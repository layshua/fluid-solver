fluid-solver
============

Realtime fluid/gas simulator solving incompressible flows. Based on Jos Stamm's paper with some improvements and written as a proving ground for optimization and then implementing it with shaders.

Soon the project will be suspended and transferred to GLSL, since it already delivered enough experimental data to start redevelopment that will allow running it more efficiently and finally in 3D. I believe this repository can work as a learning resource for new nerds inspierd with fluid dynamics, so I will leave it and improve its documentation as much as possible.
